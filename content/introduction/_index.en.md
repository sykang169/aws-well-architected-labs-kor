### When you look at the system your team is building, can you answer the question:

# “Are you Well-Architected??”


Every day, experts at AWS assist customers in architecting systems to take advantage of best practices in the cloud. We work with you on making architectural trade-offs as your designs evolve. As you deploy these systems into live environments, we learn how well these systems perform and the consequences of those trade-offs.

Based on what we have learned, we have created the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which provides a consistent set of best practices for customers and partners to evaluate their architectures, and provides a set of questions you can use to evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS best practices.
