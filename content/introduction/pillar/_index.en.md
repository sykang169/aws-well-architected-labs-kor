The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on ﬁve pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.


|Pillar|Description|
|---|---|
| **Operational Excellence** | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insights into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.|
| **Security** | The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. |
| **Reliability** | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.|
| **Cost Optimization** | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

When architecting workloads, you make trade-offs between pillars based on your business context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities. You might optimize to reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs. In e-commerce solutions, performance can affect revenue and customer propensity to buy. Security and operational excellence are generally not traded-off against the other pillars.
