#### AWS Well-Architected Framework has a advantages. 

1. Build and deploy faster
1. Lower or mitigate risks
1. Make informed decisions
1. Learn AWS best practices

#### This framework is a mechanism.
To drive better outcomes, you can build and operate workloads on the cloud. With Well-Architected built a mechanism:

Well-Architected-Framework asks questions and works with the intention of improving the architecture. It also means replacing it with a perfect mechanism to check for compliance with rules or processes.

it repeatable process that **learn** cloud service and best practice, **measure** architecture data, and **improve** architecture using it.

#### Configuration AWS Well-Architected Framework
The AWS Well-Architected Framework consists of:

1. Based on five pillar. 
   - Creating a software system is a lot like constructing a building. If the foundation is not solid, structural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building. When architecting technology solutions, if you neglect the Ô¨Åve pillars of **operational excellence**, **security**, **reliability**, **performance efficiency**, and **cost optimization**, it can become challenging to build a system that delivers on your expectations and requirements. Incorporating these pillars into your architecture will help you produce stable and efficient systems. This will allow you to focus on the other aspects of design, such as functional requirements.

1. General Design Principles
   - The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:

     - Stop guessing your capacity needs
     - Test systems at production scale
     - Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
     - Allow for evolutionary architectures
     - Drive architectures using data
     - Improve through game days
