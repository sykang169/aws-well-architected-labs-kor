During this lab exercise, we learned how to prioritize the right sizing recommendations with the goal of identifying low complexity and high savings recommendations. We initially **started with 2,534 recommendations** with a potential **saving of $86,627** but we managed to identify the **top 60 cases** with lowest complexity that together add up to **$14,699.56** of the overall potential saving.

*Group 1 (Idle)* and *Group 2 (Previous Generation)* are the less complex cases where you may want to start the right sizing exercises for your organization. As you gain more confidence and learn how to develop a regular process for right sizing, your organization will be able to rapidly act on *Group 3 (Current/modern generation)* and other cases.
