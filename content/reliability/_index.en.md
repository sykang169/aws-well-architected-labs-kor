These hands-on labs will teach you how to implement **reliable** workloads using AWS.

* **Reliability** is the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle
* **Resiliency** is the ability of a workload to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions, such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
* **Reliability** depends on multiple factors, of which **resiliency** is one the most impactful.
