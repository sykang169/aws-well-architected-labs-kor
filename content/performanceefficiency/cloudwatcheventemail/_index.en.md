### Introduce
In this lab, you create a CPU usage alarm using the AWS Management Console.
You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an email message using Amazon SNS when the alarm status changes from OK to ALARM. The alarm state changes to ALARM when the average CPU utilization of the EC2 instance exceeds the specified threshold in succession over the specified period.

### Goals
Sending e-mail to user when CPU usage is over 90%
