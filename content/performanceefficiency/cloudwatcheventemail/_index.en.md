### Introduce

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an email message using Amazon SNS. The alarm state will change when the average CPU utilization of the EC2 instance exceeds the specified threshold in succession over the specified period.

### Goals
Make an alram and start Autoscaling when CPU usage is over 90%.
Sending an e-mail to user when CPU usage is over 90%.
