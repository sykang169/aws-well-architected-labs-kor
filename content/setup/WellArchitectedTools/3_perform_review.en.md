1. Answer the REL 1 to REL 9 questions as you understand your current ability. You can use the **Info** links to help you understand what the answers mean, and watch the video to get more context on the questions. If the question does not apply to your workload, you can also skip the question by activating the **Question does not apply to workload** button.

1. If you can apply the question to your workload, but there are no details that apply, please select **Not applicable** at the bottom. If you see **Done** next to a question, the answer to that question is complete.

1. By default, the deployed environment doesn't take into account anything, so you won't have much to check. You'll need to read the original questionnaire and answer about the state of your architecture, but to proceed with today's lab, choose **None** for all questions and skip ahead. As you complete the question, select the **Next** Button at the bottom of the answers:
    ![SelectNext](/watool/100_Walkthrough_of_the_Well-Architected_Tool/Images/AWSWAT10.png)

1. When you get to the last Reliability question, or the first Performance Pillar question, select **Save and Exit:**
