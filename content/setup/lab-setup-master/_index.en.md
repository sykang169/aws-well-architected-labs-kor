## CloudFormation Template
Create a CloudFormation stack using the CloudFormation-template file provided to proactively create the AWS resources needed for the AWS AWS CodeQuality lab.

Create EC2 and VPC for 3-tier-web. We have adopted the best practices of each pillar to this web application.

To launch the CloudFormation stack, click the  [Launch Stack button](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=MasterAccountStack&templateURL=https://sykang-productionapp.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/all-account-vpc-new.yaml) to go to the CloudFormation console.
 
 
{{% button href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=MasterAccountStack&templateURL=https://sykang-productionapp.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/all-account-vpc-new.yaml" icon="fab fa-aws" icon-position="left" %}}&nbsp;Launch Stack{{% /button %}}


Type `MasterAccountStack` in Stackname.
Type `Prod` in Workload Name.

In the stack creation step, enter a stack name and choose the EC2 key pair you've created before. And in the final step, select **Acknowledge checkbox** and click **Create stack** so that CloudFormation can use a custom name when creating the IAM resource.



{{% notice note %}}
Check CloudFormation stack in **Outputs tab**, find **ALBAddress**, **DBDNS**.
