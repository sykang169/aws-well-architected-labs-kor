Then click on each filler to check the question that corresponds to the best practice applied.\n  operational excellence as an example. Select Operational Excellence at the bottom. you can go to this link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/.   In Operational Excellence labs, we managed and monitored system configuration and application using the inventory and State manager of Systems Manager. In addition, detailed information was organized to gain visibility into compliance status. And, we have configured the patch manager to automatically select and deploy operating system and software patches to all EC2 instances. These tasks can be very helpful in monitoring instances deployed in production, reducing defects, and automating patches and configurations.\nQuestions that apply to the task OPS 5. How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve flow into production? Click.   uncheck None of these, click Use configuration management systems and Perform patch management. You can also click info in the question to find out more. There is still more to be improved. Only 2 out of 11 questions were chosen. Being able to choose more questions can reduce your risk. Scroll down to see the various enhancements we can apply.   When finished, click Save and exit at the top.\n  In this way, other pillars review again the question. To reduce the risk of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, it is necessary to apply a variety of best practices and repeat reviews. In real workloads, review periodically. It eliminates the risk of architecture and creates a scalable and secure architecture. If necessary, you can also conduct a review with a partner or SA.\n  "

	"content": "    Authors  Rodney Lester, Senior Solutions Architect Manager, AWS Well-Architected Adrian Hornsby, Principal Tech Evangelist, AWS Seth Eliot, Principal Reliability Solutions Architect, AWS Well-Architected +Seyong Kang, Solutions Architect  Introduction The purpose if this lab is to teach you the fundamentals of using tests to ensure your implementation is resilient to failure by injecting failure modes into your application. This may be a familiar concept to companies that practice Failure Mode Engineering Analysis (FMEA). It is also a key component of Chaos Engineering, which uses such failure injection to test hypotheses about workload resiliency. One primary capability that AWS provides is the ability to test your systems at a production scale, under load.\nIt is not sufficient to only design for failure, you must also test to ensure that you understand how the failure will cause your systems to behave. The act of conducting these tests will also give you the ability to create playbooks how to investigate failures. You will also be able to create playbooks for identifying root causes. If you conduct these tests regularly, then you will identify changes to your application that are not resilient to failure and also create the skills to react to unexpected failures in a calm and predictable manner.\nIn this lab, you will deploy a 3-tier resource, with a reverse proxy (Application Load Balancer), Web Application on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and MySQL database using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). There is also an option to deploy the same stack into a different region, which provides you the ability to progress from simpler component failure testing to failure testing under a simulated AWS regional failure.\nThe skills you learn will help you build resilient workloads in alignment with the AWS Well-Architected Framework\nGoals:  Reduce fear of implementing resiliency testing by providing examples in common development and scripting languages Resilience testing of EC2 instances Resilience testing of RDS Multi-AZ instances Resilience testing using Availability Zones failures Resilience testing of S3 objects Learn how to implement resiliency using those tests Learn how to think about what a failure will cause within your infrastructure Learn how common AWS services can reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR)  Steps:  Preparation for Failure Injection   Test Resiliency Using EC2 Failure Injection   Test Resiliency Using RDS Failure Injection   Test Resiliency Using Availability Zone (AZ) Failure Injection   "

(Note: it is usually more efficient to use the refresh button in the console, than to refresh the browser)\n  Observe the status of the instance reported by the script. In the screen cap below it is shutting down as reported by the script and will ultimately transition to terminated.\n    4.2 System response to EC2 instance failure Watch how the service responds. Note how AWS systems help maintain service availability. Test if there is any non-availability, and if so then how long.\n4.2.1 System availability Refresh the service website several times: For the website\u0026rsquo;s address, use ALBDNS in the Outputs of the CloudFormation MasterAccount Stack created in the lab setup.\n Website remains available The remaining two EC2 instances are handling all the requests (as per the displayed instance_id)  4.2.2 Load balancing Load balancing ensures service requests are not routed to unhealthy resources, such as the failed EC2 instance.\n  Go to the Target Groups console you already have open (or click here to open a new one)\n If there is more than one target group, select the one with the Load Balancer named ResiliencyTestLoadBalancer    Click on the Targets tab and observe:\n  Status of the instances in the group.

The load balancer will not send traffic to it until it is completed initializing. It will ultimately transition to healthy and then start receiving traffic.\n  Note the new instance was started in the same Availability Zone as the failed one.

The auto scaling for this service is a simple configuration that ensures at least three EC2 instances are running. More complex configurations in response to CPU or network load are also possible using AWS.\n  Go to the Auto Scaling Groups console you already have open (or click here to open a new one)\n If there is more than one auto scaling group, select the one with the name that starts with WebServersforResiliencyTesting    Click on the Activity History tab and observe:\n You can check instance status and time.     Draining allows existing, in-flight requests made to an instance to complete, but it will not send any new requests to the instance. Learn more: After the lab see this blog post for more information on draining.\nLearn more: After the lab see Auto Scaling Groups to learn more how auto scaling groups are setup and how they distribute instances, and Dynamic Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for more details on setting up auto scaling that responds to demand\n4.2.4 EC2 failure injection - conclusion Deploying multiple servers and Elastic Load Balancing enables a service suffer the loss of a server with no availability disruptions as user traffic is automatically routed to the healthy servers. Amazon Auto Scaling ensures unhealthy hosts are removed and replaced with healthy ones to maintain high availability.\n"

	"content": "NOTE: In order to complete this step you need to have Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization enabled, you can do that by going to AWS Cost Explorer, Recommendations (left bar) section.\nAmazon EC2 Resource Optimization offers right sizing recommendations in AWS Cost Explorer without any additional cost. These recommendations identify likely idle and underutilized instances across your accounts, regions and tags. To generate these recommendations, AWS analyzes your historical EC2 resource usage (using Amazon CloudWatch) and your existing reservation footprint to identify opportunities for cost savings (e.g., by terminating idle instances or downsizing active instances to lower-cost options within the same family/generation).\n  Navigate to the AWS Cost Explorer page   Select Recommendations in the left menu bar   Click on the View All link associated with the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization Recommendations section.   In case you haven’t enabled the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization please do so (no additional cost), it may take up to 24 hours in order to generate your first recommendations. Only regular or payer accounts can enable it and by default both linked and payer accounts will be able to access their rightsizing recommendations unless the payer account specifically prohibits it on the settings page (top right). To improve the quality of recommendations, AWS might use other utilization metrics that you might be collecting, such as disk or memory utilization. All resource utilization metrics are anonymized and aggregated before AWS uses them for model training. If you would like to opt out of this experience and request your metrics not be stored and used for model improvement, please submit an AWS support ticket. For more information, see AWS Service Terms.\nAssuming you had enabled the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization Recommendations, you will be presented with a screen that provides recommendations (if any exists):    Optimization opportunities – The number of recommendations available based on your resources and usage Estimated monthly savings – The sum of the projected monthly savings associated with each of the recommendations provided Estimated savings (%) – The available savings relative to the direct Amazon EC2 costs (On-Demand) associated with the instances in the recommendation list  You can also filter your recommendations by the type of action (Idle and Underutilized), Linked Account, Region and Tag.\nClick on view next to a recommendation, to view the details:   How are the potential savings calculated? AWS will first examine the instance running during the last 14 days to identify if it was partially or fully covered by an RI or running On-Demand. Another factor is whether the RI is instance size-flexible. The cost to run the instance is calculated based on the On-Demand hours and the hourly rate for the instance type. For each recommendation, AWS calculates the cost to operate a new instance. AWS assumes that an instance size-flexible Reserved Instance will cover the new instance in the same way as the previous instance. Savings are calculated based on the number of On-Demand running hours and the difference in On-Demand rates. If the Reserved Instance isn\u0026rsquo;t instance size-flexible, the savings calculation is based on whether the instance hours during the last 14 days are operated as On-Demand. AWS will only provide recommendations with estimated savings greater than or equal to $0.\nAmazon EC2 Resource Optimization recommendations already excludes Spot usage and takes into consideration the existing Reserved Instances and Savings Plan footprint to provide recommendations. There are two types of recommended actions: Terminate if the instance is considered idle (max CPU utilization is at or below 1%) or Downsize if the instance is underutilized (max CPU utilization is between 1% and 40%).\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "6.1 AZ failure injection This failure injection will simulate a critical problem with one of the three AWS Availability Zones (AZs) used by your service. AWS Availability Zones are powerful tools for helping build highly available applications. If an application is partitioned across AZs, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as lightning strikes, tornadoes, earthquakes and more.\n Go to the RDS Dashboard in the AWS Console at http://console.aws.amazon.com/rds and note which Availability Zone the AWS RDS primary DB instance is in.  Note: If you previously ran the RDS Failure Injection test, you must wait until the console shows the AZs for the primary and standby instances as swapped, before running this test A good way to run the AZ failure injection is first in an AZ other than this - we\u0026rsquo;ll call this Scenario 1 Then try it again in the same AZ as the AWS RDS primary DB instance - we\u0026rsquo;ll call this Scenario 2 Taking down two out of the three AZs this way is an unlikely use case, however it will show how AWS systems work to maintain service integrity despite extreme circumstances. And executing this way illustrates the impact and response under the two different scenarios.    This lab example is us-east-2, if you use another region, consider region and AZ name.\n   To simulate failure of an AZ, select one of the Availability Zones used by your service (us-east-2a, us-east-2b, or us-east-2c) as \u0026lt;az\u0026gt;\n For scenario 1 select an AZ that is neither primary nor secondary for your RDS DB instance. Given the following RDS console you would choose us-east-2c For scenario 2 select the AZ that is primary for your RDS DB instance. Given the following RDS console you would choose us-east-2b    To fail one of your AZ, run the script below using your VPC ID in Cloud9\u0026rsquo;s terminal. Replace \u0026lt;vpc-id\u0026gt; with the VPC ID you copyed before. and replace \u0026lt;az\u0026gt; with the your az.\n  ./failover_az.sh \u0026lt;az\u0026gt; \u0026lt;vpc-id\u0026gt;  The specific output will vary based on the command used.  Note whether an RDS failover was initiated. This would be the case if you selected the AZ containing the AWS RDS primary DB instance    6.2 System response to AZ failure Watch how the service responds. Note how AWS systems help maintain service availability. Test if there is any non-availability, and if so then how long.\n6.2.1 System availability Refresh the service website several times\n Scenario 1: If you selected an AZ not containing the AWS RDS primary DB instance then you should see uninterrupted availability Scenario 2: If you selected the AZ containing the AWS RDS primary DB instance, then an availability loss similar to what you saw with RDS fault injection testing will occur.  6.2.2 Scenario 1 - Load balancer and web server tiers This scenario is similar to the EC2 failure injection test because there is only one EC2 server per AZ in our architecture. Look at the same screens you as for that test:\n EC2 Instances Load Balancer Target group Auto Scaling Groups  One difference from the EC2 failure test that you will observe is that auto scaling will bring up the replacement EC2 instance in an AZ that already has an EC2 instance as it attempts to balance the requested three EC2 instances across the remaining AZs.\n6.2.3 Scenario 2 - Load balancer, web server, and data tiers This scenario is similar to a combination of the RDS failure injection along with EC2 failure injection. In addition to the EC2 related screens look at the Amazon RDS console, navigate to your DB screen and observe the following tabs:\n Configuration Monitoring Logs \u0026amp; Events  6.2.4 AZ failure injection - conclusion This similarity between scenario 1 and the EC2 failure test, and between scenario 2 and the RDS failure test is illustrative of how an AZ failure impacts your system. The resources in that AZ will have no or limited availability. With the strong partitioning and isolation between Availability Zones however, resources in the other AZs continue to provide your service with needed functionality. Scenario 1 results in loss of the load balancer and web server capabilities in one AZ, while Scenario 2 adds to that the additional loss of the data tier. By ensuring that every tier of your system is in multiple AZs, you create a partitioned architecture resilient to failure.\n6.2.5 AZ failure recovery This step is optional. To simulate the AZ returning to health do the following:\n Go to the Auto Scaling Group console Select the WebServersforResiliencyTesting auto scaling group Actions \u0026raquo; Edit In the Subnet field add any ResiliencyVPC-PrivateSubnets that are missing (there should be three total) and Save Go to the Network ACL console Look at the NACL entries for the VPC called ResiliencyVPC For any of these NACLs that are not Default do the following  Select the NACL Actions \u0026raquo; Edit subnet associations Uncheck all boxes and click Edit Actions \u0026raquo; Delete network ACL     Note how the auto scaling redistributes the EC2 serves across the availability zones  "

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Please try this exercise in a real user account. Currently, it cannot be performed in a lab environment.\n In order to complete this step you need to have Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization enabled, you can do that going to the AWS Cost Explorer, Recommendations (left bar) section.\n If you have just installed the CloudWatch agent at your instances it may take a couple of days for Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization to start to provide updated recommendations, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you don\u0026rsquo;t see the memory data during the first checks.\n Now that we have Memory data as a custom metric in CloudWatch let\u0026rsquo;s check how that affects the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization recommendations.\nAmazon EC2 Resource Optimization offers right sizing recommendations in the AWS Cost Explorer without any additional cost. These recommendations identify likely idle and underutilized instances across your accounts, regions and tags. To generate these recommendations, AWS analyzes your historical EC2 resource usage (last 14 days using Amazon CloudWatch) and your existing reservation footprint to identify opportunities for cost savings. There are two types of recommended actions: Terminate if the instance is considered idle (max CPU utilization is at or below 1%) or Downsize if the instance is underutilized (max CPU utilization is between 1% and 40%).\nBy default Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization doesn\u0026rsquo;t need memory datapoint to provide recommendations, but if that information is available it will take that into consideration updating the Downsize recommendation for instances that now have max CPU and MEM utilization between 1% and 40% over the past 14 days. Let\u0026rsquo;s validate that with the following steps.\n  Navigate to the AWS Cost Explorer page   Select Recommendations in the left menu bar   Click on the View All link associated with the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization Recommendations section. In case you haven’t enabled the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization please do so (no additional cost), it may take up to 24 hours in order to generate your first recommendations. Only regular or payer accounts can enable it and by default both linked and payer accounts will be able to access their rightsizing recommendations unless the payer account specifically prohibits it on the settings page (top right).\n  Assuming you had enabled the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization Recommendations, you will be presented with a screen that provides recommendations (if any exists). Click to view the Resource Optimization recommendations.\n Optimization opportunities – The number of recommendations available based on your resources and usage Estimated monthly savings – The sum of the projected monthly savings associated with each of the recommendations provided Estimated savings (%) – The available savings relative to the direct Amazon EC2 costs (On-Demand) associated with the instances in the recommendation list  You can also filter your recommendations by the type of action (Idle and Underutilized), Linked Account, Region and Tag.\n  Understanding the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization recommendations.\nIn the example below we have a recommendation to downsize the t2.micro (1vCPU for a 2h 24m burst and 1GB RAM) to a t2.nano (1vCPU for a 1h 12m burst and 0.5 GB RAM) and save $12 USD per year.\nIn the example below we have a recommendation to downsize the t2.micro (1vCPU for a 2h 24m burst and 1GB RAM) to a t2.nano (1vCPU for a 1h 12m burst and 0.5 GB RAM) and save $12 USD per year. Over the past 14 days the maximum CPU utilization for this instance was only 9% and this instance was running for 86 hours and all of these were On Demand hours. Observe that there is no memory information available so Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization will ignore that datapoint and recommend to downsize to a t2.nano that have half of the memory available of a t2.micro.\nThat can be risky and waste engineer time when testing if the proposed right sizing option is valid or not. That said you can improve the accuracy of this recommendation with the CloudWatch agent we just installed.\nIn this other example we see a recommendation to downsize a r5.8xlarge (32 vCPU and 256GB RAM) to a r5.4xlarge (16 vCPU and 128GB RAM) and save $2,412 USD per year. On this case we have both CPU and Memory information available: the maximum CPU utilization was 21% and Memory was only 5%. That makes the case for downsize much stronger and the recommendation will even try estimate the CPU and Memory utilization for the new instance size. Keep in mind that this is just a simple estimation based on the past utilization data from CloudWatch, before executing the modification all the required load tests must be performed to avoid any impacts on your workload.\nAs explained above the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization logic will recommend to downsize any instances where the maximum CPU utilization was between 1% to 40% over the past 14 days. If you do have memory information available the Amazon EC2 Resource Optimization will now consider to downsize instances that have both CPU and Memory maximum utilization between 1% and 40%. Idle recommendations are not impacted if memory data is available, so any EC2 instance that during the past 14 days never passed 1% of CPU utlization will be automatically flagged as idle.\n  "

	"content": "The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on ﬁve pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.\n   Pillar Description     Operational Excellence The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.   Security The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security.   Reliability The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS.   Performance Efficiency The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.   Cost Optimization The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.    When architecting workloads, you make trade-oﬀs between pillars based on your business context. These business decisions can drive your engineering priorities. You might optimize to reduce cost at the expense of reliability in development environments, or, for mission-critical solutions, you might optimize reliability with increased costs. In ecommerce solutions, performance can affect revenue and customer propensity to buy. Security and operational excellence are generally not traded-oﬀ against the other pillars.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s start each pillar hand on labs!   "

It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.   Application Load Balancer A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.   Amazon RDS Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.   AWS Auto Scaling AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for resources including Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas. AWS Auto Scaling makes scaling simple with recommendations that allow you to optimize performance, costs, or balance between them. If you’re already using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 instances, you can now combine it with AWS Auto Scaling to scale additional resources for other AWS services. With AWS Auto Scaling, your applications always have the right resources at the right time.    -Let\u0026rsquo;s deploy Cloud9 \u0026amp; CloudFomration stack.\n"

The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.\nDesign Principles for Operational Excellence Perform operations as code In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events.\nMake frequent, small, reversible changes Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible).\nRefine operations procedures frequently As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload, evolve your procedures appropriately. Set up regular game days to review and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them.\nAnticipate failure Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.\nLearn from all operational failures Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization.\nSteps:  AWS Systems Manager   Resource Management   Patch Management   "

	"content": " There are set up tasks and pre-requisites that must be satisfied prior to using Systems Manager to manage your EC2 instances or on-premises systems in hybrid environments.\n AWS Systems Manager AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. With Systems Manager, you can group resources, like Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon S3 buckets, or Amazon RDS instances, by application, view operational data for monitoring and troubleshooting, and take action on your groups of resources. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale. Inventory AWS Systems Manager Inventory provides visibility into your Amazon EC2 and on-premises computing environment. You can use Inventory to collect metadata from your managed instances. You can store this metadata in a central Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, and then use built-in tools to query the data and quickly determine which instances are running the software and configurations required by your software policy, and which instances need to be updated. You can configure Inventory on all of your managed instances by using a one-click procedure. You can also configure and view inventory data from multiple AWS Regions and accounts.\nState Manager AWS Systems Manager State Manager is a secure and scalable configuration management service that automates the process of keeping your Amazon EC2 and hybrid infrastructure in a state that you define.\nPatch Manager AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances with both security related and other types of updates. You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications. (On Windows Server, application support is limited to updates for Microsoft applications.) You can use Patch Manager to install Service Packs on Windows instances and perform minor version upgrades on Linux instances. You can patch fleets of EC2 instances or your on-premises servers and virtual machines (VMs) by operating system type. This includes supported versions of Windows Server, Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, CentOS, Debian Server, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and Ubuntu Server. You can scan instances to see only a report of missing patches, or you can scan and automatically install all missing patches.\nMaintenance Windows AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows let you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches. Maintenance Windows also lets you schedule actions on numerous other AWS resource types, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys, and many more.\nRun Command AWS Systems Manager Run Command lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. Run Command enables you to automate common administrative tasks and perform ad hoc configuration changes at scale. You can use Run Command from the AWS console, the AWS Command Line Interface, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, or the AWS SDKs. Run Command is offered at no additional cost.\nFor details, refer to Link.\n"

In this example, it is showing that we have an EC2 instance in use and it is marked as OK.   The upper right shows alarms in your account, which will contain up to four alarms that are in the ALARM state or it will show those that most recently changed state. These upper areas enable you to assess the health of your AWS services, by seeing the alarm states in every service and the alarms that most recently changed state. This helps you monitor and quickly diagnose issues.\n  Below these areas is spot for a custom default dashboard that you can create that is named CloudWatch-Default This is a convenient way for you to add metrics about your own custom services or applications to the overview page, or to bring forward additional key metrics from AWS services that you most want to monitor. In this example, we do not have a custom default dashboard created.

	"content": "Systems Manager: Patch Manager AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager automates the process of patching managed instances with security related updates.\n Warnings\n The operating systems supported by Patch Manager may vary from those supported by the SSM Agent. AWS does not test patches for Windows or Linux before making them available in Patch Manager . If any updates are installed by Patch Manager the patched instance is rebooted. Always test patches thoroughly before deploying to production environments.   Patch Baselines Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches. Later in this lab we will schedule patching to occur on a regular basis using a Systems Manager Maintenance Window task. Patch Manager integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon CloudWatch Events to provide a secure patching experience that includes event notifications and the ability to audit usage.\n5.1 Create a Patch Baseline   Under Instances and Nodes in the AWS Systems Manager navigation bar, choose Patch Manager.\n  Click the View predefined patch baselines link under the Configure patching button on the upper right.   Choose Create patch baseline.   On the Create patch baseline page in the Provide patch baseline details section:\n Enter a Name for your custom patch baseline, such as AmazonLinuxSecAndNonSecBaseline. Optionally enter a description, such as Amazon Linux patch baseline including security and non-security patches. Select Amazon Linux2 to Operation system.     In the Approval rules section:\n Examine the options in the lists and ensure that Product, Classification, and Severity have values of All. Leave the Auto approval delay at its default of 0 days. Change the value of Compliance reporting - optional to Critical.  Choose Add another rule. In the new rule, change the value of Compliance reporting - optional to Medium. Check the box under Include non-security updates to include all Amazon Linux updates when patching.     In the Patch exceptions section in the Rejected patches - optional text box, enter system-release.* This will reject patches to new Amazon Linux releases that may advance you beyond the Patch Manager supported operating systems prior to your testing new releases.\n  For Linux operating systems, you can optionally define an alternative patch source repository. Choose the X in the Patch sources area to remove the empty patch source definition. Choose Create patch baseline and you will go to the Patch Baselines page where the AWS provided default patch baselines, and your custom baseline, are displayed.   Click Create patch baseline button and finish. If an approved patch is reported as missing, the option you choose in Compliance reporting, such as Critical or Medium, determines the severity of the compliance violation reported in System Manager Compliance.\n  Patch Groups A patch group is an optional method to organize instances for patching. For example, you can create patch groups for different operating systems (Linux or Windows), different environments (Development, Test, and Production), or different server functions (web servers, file servers, databases). Patch groups can help you avoid deploying patches to the wrong set of instances. They can also help you avoid deploying patches before they have been adequately tested.\nYou create a patch group by using Amazon EC2 tags. Unlike other tagging scenarios across Systems Manager, a patch group must be defined with the tag key: Patch Group (tag keys are case sensitive). You can specify any value (for example, web servers) but the key must be Patch Group.\n NoteAn instance can only be in one patch group.\n After you create a patch group and tag instances, you can register the patch group with a patch baseline. By registering the patch group with a patch baseline, you ensure that the correct patches are installed during the patching execution. When the system applies a patch baseline to an instance, the service checks if a patch group is defined for the instance.\n If the instance is assigned to a patch group, the system checks to see which patch baseline is registered to that group. If a patch baseline is found for that group, the system applies that patch baseline. If an instance isn\u0026rsquo;t assigned to a patch group, the system automatically uses the currently configured default patch baseline.  Assign a Patch Group  Choose the Baseline ID of your newly created baseline to enter the details screen.(If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the Baseline ID, turn the page. The baseline name created in this lab is AmazonLinuxSecAndNonSecBaseline.)  Choose Actions in the top right of the window and select Modify patch groups.  In the Modify patch groups window under Patch groups, enter Critical, choose Add, and then choose Close to be returned to the Patch Baseline details screen.  Click Close, and back to Patch Baseline page for check detail information.    Note\n If an instance is assigned to a patch group, the system checks based on the patch registered in that group. If there is a patch criterion for that group, the system applies that patch criterion. Except for Bastion Host, the two instances belong to a patch group called Critical, so they follow the patch criteria you just created. *If an instance is not assigned to a patch group, the system will automatically use the default patch baseline currently configured.

The Impact of Operations as Code In a traditional environment, you would have had to set up the systems and software to perform these activities. You would require a server to execute your scripts. You would need to manage authentication credentials across all of your systems.\nOperations as code reduces the resources, time, risk, and complexity of performing operations tasks and ensures consistent execution. You can take operations as code and automate operations activities by using scheduling and event triggers. Through integration at the infrastructure level you avoid \u0026ldquo;swivel chair\u0026rdquo; processes that require multiple interfaces and systems to complete a single operations activity.\n"
